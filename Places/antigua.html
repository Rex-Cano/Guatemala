        <h2>Short Summary</h2>
        <p>Antigua is a beautiful location. So many old structures, the enviorment <br>
            the restaurants are in old stone structures but the insde is really cool, <br>
            and so much more. You actually have to be there to see it. Also, there <br> 
            is a really cool place called "La mano de Oro" which is basically <br> 
            a hand sticking out the mounatin and you can walk on top of it. </p>

                        outside. </li>
                    <li>The traffic there is whenever you try to go back kills people. <br>
