        <h3>How expensive is it? ðŸ’² - ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Pros.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you don't like to do much, you don't have too. <br> 
                        Honestly, it's really cheap. Canopy and wall climbing <br> 
                        is only Q20. </li>
                    <li>If you like paintball, you can buy more balls there and <br> 
                        they have all the equipment to protect yourself. Now if <br> 
                        you wan see the world burn than you don't have to get anything. </li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><h4>Cons</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>There will be a lot of traffic!!! So if you go, then go on a  <br> 
                        weekday because on weekends it gets HEAVY. </li>
                    <li>Never been there so I dont't know how big the Go Kart track is. </li>
            </ul></li>
