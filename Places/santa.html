        <h2>Short Summary</h2>
        <p> This place is really somewhere you go to if you want to relax. <br> 
            It's a Spa, restaurant, and multiple different pools that you <br> 
            you can go to. Also, the pools are thermal. My favorite has to be the <br> 
            one that is between 80F - 90F. </p>
