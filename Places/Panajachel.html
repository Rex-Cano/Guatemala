        <h2>Short Summary</h2>
        <p>This is the farthest location you can go to. You can go there in <br> 
            one day but to go back in the same day will be difficult. It's a 5 hour <br> 
            drive going there and that not counting traffic. It's amazing and super <br> 
            touristict. One of the places they always recommend for you to go to <br> 
            when coming to Guatemala. </p>

            <li><h4>Pros.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot, and I mean a lot of things you can buy that are Tipica.</li>
                    <li>There is mountain close by that you can hike and its super big.</li>
                    <li>Before getting there, there is a location called TecpÃ¡n that is <br> 
                        really delicious for breakfast. </li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><h4>Cons</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Super far and its more like a 2 day trip. </li>
                    <li>To get to the main area you want to go to you have to go in a boat. </li>
                    <li>Once again, you need to be with someone who is Guatemalan <br> 
                        they also charge you more if you are a tourist. </li>
            </ul></li>
